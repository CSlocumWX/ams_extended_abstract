\section{Introduction}
Add your text here.

You can use add inline citations using the same format as with the
American Meteorological Society manuscript \LaTeX template
\citep[e.g.,][]{Eliassen1951}.

In this template, math stays in a serif font as shown by this
example for the cosine:
\begin{equation}
    y = \cos (x),
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the independent variable and $y$ is the dependent.
